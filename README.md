# Space Route Planning System Documentation

This document serves as a comprehensive guide for the Space Route Planning System developed to assist astronauts in planning trips throughout the solar system. The system is designed to be intuitive and functional, incorporating a realistic simulation of fuel consumption and identifying optimal refueling points.

## Functional Requirements

The system was developed with the following functional requirements in mind:

### User's Current Location

- Determine and display the user's current location in the solar system.
- Display the user's current planet on the system interface.

### Travel Simulation and Fuel Calculation

- Simulate the trip when a destination is selected.
- Calculate the required fuel based on the distance to the destination and the spacecraft's fuel consumption ratio.

### Travel and User Position Update

- Allow the trip if there is sufficient fuel.
- Update the user's position to the selected destination.
- Update the remaining fuel amount.

### Refueling

- Recommend the nearest planet with a refueling station if the fuel is insufficient.
- Refueling stations are located on Mercury, Earth, Saturn, and Uranus.

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Distances Between Planets

- Precise distances between planets have been defined and are used to calculate the necessary fuel.

### Fuel Tank Capacity and Consumption

- The spacecraft's fuel tank capacity is 90,000 liters.
- The spacecraft's fuel consumption ratio is 0.0001 liters per kilometer.

## Additional Features

### Interactive Map of Planets

- Display all planets with icons indicating refueling stations.
- Dynamically position a spacecraft icon on the map as the user travels.

### Travel History

- Store all trips during the browser session.
- Detailed information about each trip, including date, time, origin, destination, fuel before and after the trip.

### User Interface and Interaction

- Toasts for successful or failed travel feedback.
- Interactive alerts for refueling when you are on a planet with a station or when you are isolated.

## Internationalization

- Support for English and Portuguese, making it easy for a global audience to use.
